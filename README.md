# Background

Model-based systems engineering is a methodology focusing on domain models as the primary information source rather than documents. Models of joining technologies can be used to simulate a joining process as a subdomain inside a larger construction. The software is decision-tool for comparing joining technologies modeled inside the software Cameo Systems Modeler, where each joining technology is modeled with the systems engineering language SysML. 

The approach is a multicriteria model-based decision comparing each model with specific conditions from the user. The code is based on this approach, written in my bachelorthesis and can be transfered to other SysML models. 

# Documentation

The thesis can be also used as a documentation of the software architecture.
